He awoke again to the endless grid. The blocks fell with a mechanical certainty, 
and he moved them with the same automated precision. Hours, days, years â€” he could no longer tell. 

Every line cleared brought a fleeting sense of control, yet as soon as he thought he might rest, 
another piece descended, another decision demanded, another moment stolen from freedom. 

He remembered sunlight, once, or maybe it was a dream. The corridor stretched infinitely above and below; 
the ceiling a blur, the floor a distant memory. Each move he made seemed meaningless, 
each drop of a piece just another repetition in an unending cycle. 

Sometimes he imagined an exit, a door at the end of the tunnel. He raced pieces faster, 
cleared lines frantically, but the walls remained, closing in tighter with every success. 

The score climbed endlessly, but the number meant nothing. Each rotation, each shift, 
was just a testament to futility. There was no rest, no pause, no victory. 

His body ached, his mind numbed, yet he continued. For even if he stopped, 
the world beyond these grids would not return. He was trapped, forever moving, 
forever stacking, forever losing, forever alone. 

The blocks fell, he moved them. The cycle repeated. And still, he could not see the end. 
The tunnel stretched on into darkness, and he played, and played, and played.
